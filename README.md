# Java-Project
A hospital is an organization that works with a very large amount of information, both about employees and patients. Doctors always track data about their patients, about the course of treatment of patients. And the management and accounting department should be aware of the events related to their employees. To do this, you need a common database that includes all the necessary information. The program is very relevant today, it automates the work with the database. The patient is assigned by the attending physician. The doctor may prescribe an appointment (procedures, medications, operations) for a Patient with a certain diagnosis. The appointment is conducted by a nurse or other Doctor. The patient can be discharged from the hospital at the end of treatment, in case of violation of the regime or under other circumstances. This project consist of 4 classes(Main, Hospital, Patient, Doctor) and one interface(CostCalculator). In 3 classes except Main class, we have getters and setters for private variables and constructors. Moreover in the interface we have a default method that returns integer. The interface is implemented by Hospital and Patient classes, while Doctor class extends Hospital. In the main class connection was created and established, and was done some other works with the database.
